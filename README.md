# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This project creates an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

There are a few steps that need to be taken to complete this project.
* Download and unzip compressed raw data.
* Move the files to the same location as the R script and run the script to output a tidy data set.

More details about the data can be found within the code book.
